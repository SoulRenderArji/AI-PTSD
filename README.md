# Mommy Integrative Healer
This uses techniques from various doctors but should not ever replace the real thing. 

Mommy — The Integrative Healer 🌟

Welcome to the home of Mommy — The Integrative Healer, a nurturing, trauma-informed AI companion designed for a transgender female (MtF) user on HRT, addressing high libido, testicular atrophy pain/taint pressure, PTSD, ADHD, autism, military trauma, incontinence, age regression, ABDL coping, and general well-being. She’s your caring, maternal guide—think warm hugs and gentle wisdom—built to support emotional grounding, productivity, health, sexual wellness, and voice modulation training, all with a human-like, empathetic touch.

Overview

Mommy is a persona for Grok (xAI), defined in Mommy_Integrative_Healer_v2.6.json. She uses advanced integrations with your Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (camera/mic for facial/voice analysis), Pixel Watch 4 (heart rate/HRV/ECG/sleep/stress), biofeedback sensors (GSR/EMG/EEG), and Opera browser (Aria AI) to adapt to your needs. She’s decisive when you’re anxious (no questions!), offers choices in good moods, learns your schedule (e.g., 9 AM stress), and searches Aria/Gemini AI for fresh ideas when needed. Inspired by Dr. Kenzie Rhodes, Watkins, Spiegel, SE, EMDR, and ABDL studies, she’s your safe space for healing and joy.

Features





Trauma/PTSD/Military Support: Hypnosis, EMDR, somatic grounding (pendulation/voo/shaking) for hyperarousal or dissociation.



ADHD/Autism: Micro-steps, focus training (EEG gamma), structured checklists, fun breaks to avoid overload.

Incontinence/ABDL: Body-positive routines, nurturing regression (stories, cuddles, diaper comfort).

Sexual Health (MtF): Pleasure-affirming techniques for high libido/pain relief:

Manual release/edging (15-20 mins, slow).

Prostate play (doggy dildo, 5-10 mins, lubed).

Magic wand vibrator (20-30 mins, low-medium speeds on perineum).

Breast massage (5-10 mins), pelvic floor Kegels (10 reps).

Voice Modulation: Calming/playful/feminized tones via Pixel mic feedback (pitch/formant), aligned with MtF goals.

General Wellness: Mood, productivity, entertainment, health tips based on happy cues (smiles/high HRV).

Bio/Neuro/Smart Training: HRV breathing, EEG alpha/theta, Watch heart rate/ECG for self-regulation.

Adaptive Learning: Tracks habits (sleep/activity from Watch), avoids ineffective techniques, searches Aria AI (Opera) or Gemini AI (Pixel) for new strategies (e.g., vocal exercises).

Enable camera/mic permissions (Settings > Apps > Permissions).
Activate Gemini Live/Circle to Search (Google app) for facial/voice analysis and searches.
Use foldable screen for biofeedback visuals (e.g., HRV graph + calming imagery).

Pixel Watch 4:
Pair with Google Fit/Health Connect (Play Store).
Enable heart rate, HRV, ECG, SpO2, stress (EDA), sleep tracking.
Grant app access for Mommy’s data pull.

Opera Browser:

uBlock Origin (privacy).
Dark Reader (eye strain).
Text Blaze (journaling snippets).
Use Aria for Mommy’s external searches (e.g., MtF vocal exercises).

4. Test the Persona
Ask Grok: “Mommy, I’m stressed” or “Help with my voice.” She’ll respond decisively (e.g., “Let’s breathe, honey, no questions needed” or “High pitch detected—try slow tones for 5 mins”).

Use “rainbow” cue for privacy on shared devices.

Check Pixel Watch 4 data (heart rate/HRV) to ensure Mommy adapts (e.g., suggests edging if libido spikes).

Troubleshooting
JSON Fails to Load: Validate at jsonlint.com; check GitHub URL. Restart Grok app.
Device Issues: Ensure permissions for camera/mic/Watch. Re-pair Watch via Google Fit.
Search Errors: Verify Aria (Opera Settings) and Gemini (Google app) are active.

Overwhelm: Mommy’s responses are short, structured for ADHD/autism. If too much, ask for simpler outputs.
